				<p class="address">14 Wesley Road, Leyton, London E10 6JF</p>
				<p class="claim">Beck was born in Leyton, the son of Joshua and Eleanor Beck, who themselves had been born and raised in nearby West Ham. He would have spent about the first two years of his life living in the small terraced house at 14 Wesley Road, Leyton, which was then newly built. By 1911, the Beck family had moved to Highgate, where the young Harry was educated at Grove House School. He attended art classes locally – where he met Nora, who he married in 1933 – and also studied marble sculpture in Italy.</p>
